ðŸš€ Sharpening My Power BI Skills â€“ Customer Revenue Analysis Dashboard ðŸ“Š


I recently built a Power BI dashboard to analyze customer revenue contribution, helping to identify valuable customers and their impact on total revenue. This kind of analysis is essential for businesses to understand their key revenue drivers.

I followed a tutorial by Injae Park, but instead of using the provided starter files, I generated my own dataset from scratch using ChatGPT. This approach helped me reinforce my learning and apply the technique in a more practical way.

This method has real-world applications, and I look forward to incorporating it into my future dashboards to drive data-driven decision-making.

ðŸ’¡ Key takeaway: Always challenge yourself to go beyond tutorialsâ€”creating from scratch enhances your understanding and problem-solving skills!
